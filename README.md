# Cloud Location Generation Mask
![Cloud Generation Example](CLOUDGENERATION.png)
This repository provides the implementation of a **synthetic cloud location mask generator**, designed to create realistic cloud patterns for injection into optical satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2).  
The masks simulate cloud coverage in varying shapes, densities, and deformations, making them suitable for robustness evaluation of deep learning models in **land cover semantic segmentation (LCS)** tasks.

## Features
- Generate cloud masks programmatically
- Control parameters such as density, randomness, and shape
- Easy to extend and integrate with other projects
